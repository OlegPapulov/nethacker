# Next experiment

## Result

- iteration 1: 0.063 not kept (no-cell-improved). Decreases the mean by 0.001 (from 0.064 to 0.063). Moved the weak-hunger eat step to the front of the strategy list.
- iteration 2: 0.060 not kept (no-cell-improved). Decreases the mean by 0.003 (from 0.063 to 0.060). Lowered that threshold from weak to hungry.
- iteration 1: 0.064 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.064). Added a corpse-distance cap that the weak-hunger gate never reaches.
- iteration 2: 0.063 not kept (no-cell-improved). Decreases the mean by 0.002 (from 0.064 to 0.063). Raised several flee and Elbereth thresholds and ate more corpses from the pack.
- iteration 1: 0.064 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.064). No code change. The tree matches the seed.
- iteration 2: 0.064 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.064). No code change. The agent wrote a notebook and left the parent in place.
- iteration 1: 0.077 kept (registered). Increases the mean by 0.013 (from 0.064 to 0.077). Capped a weak-hunger corpse walk at 20 squares.
- iteration 2: 0.077 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.077). The judge table matches iteration 1.
- iteration 1: 0.077 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.077). No code change.
- iteration 2: 0.077 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.077). Read the spell menu and deleted the cast.
- iteration 1: none not kept (gate:child identical to parent). The tree matched the parent, so the judge did not run.

## Why it stopped

killed by a soldier ant (2 of 15).

## What is the problem

Mean progress is 0.077. The bot is kept only if the next mean is strictly higher on `wiz-hum-cha-mal`.

## What might solve it

The usual stop is killed by a soldier ant. Leave the weak-hunger corpse walk capped at 20 squares. Do not edit it. Five games die on depth 1 by standing in a melee: a kobold zombie, a bat, a coyote, a bat, and a newt. A wizard loses that trade. In `emergency_strategy`, when `imminent_death_on_melee` is true for an adjacent monster that is not a pet and not in `WEAK_MONSTERS`, leave an uncommented `self.cast('force bolt', ...)` if energy is at least 5 and the spell is known, and otherwise move toward a door or a corridor. Do not cast at every adjacent glyph. Do not delete that cast. Call `parse_spellcast_view` once the role is known so the letter is real, and do not clear `known_spells` in `_parse`. Do not hardcode a spell letter.

Edit `autoascend/` and exit. The judge measures that tree.
