# Next experiment

## Proposal

One rewrite of one function: `_update_level_corpses` in `autoascend/agent.py`.

The pet does a share of the kills on the farm floor, but its victims' corpses are never recorded as
food. The two kill-message forms the function already parses cannot name them: "The kitten kills the
lichen." needs no exclamation mark, and the form that ends with one reads the killer, not the victim,
as the corpse. Those corpses rot uneaten, so the wizard runs out of food on the first dungeon level
sooner and banks less experience before the farm runs dry. The rewrite parses the victim out of the
pet-kill messages ("The <pet> kills the <victim>" and "The <victim> is killed/destroyed by the <pet>"),
and leaves the vanished-glyph test in place so that only victims that actually died on screen are
recorded as a fresh corpse.

The same rewrite turns `assert mons.any()` into a skip. That assert aborted the run whenever a kill
message named no visible vanished glyph (an off-screen kill, or a phrase that is not a monster at
all). Once pet kills are parsed, such messages would fire on every off-screen pet kill and end the
run, so the guard becomes available only when a vanished glyph really exists.

## Result

- iteration 1: 0.063 not kept (no-cell-improved). Decreases the mean by 0.001 (from 0.064 to 0.063). Moved the weak-hunger eat step to the front of the strategy list.
- iteration 2: 0.060 not kept (no-cell-improved). Decreases the mean by 0.003 (from 0.063 to 0.060). Lowered that threshold from weak to hungry.
- iteration 1: 0.064 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.064). Added a corpse-distance cap that the weak-hunger gate never reaches.
- iteration 2: 0.063 not kept (no-cell-improved). Decreases the mean by 0.002 (from 0.064 to 0.063). Raised several flee and Elbereth thresholds and ate more corpses from the pack.
- iteration 1: 0.064 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.064). No code change. The tree matches the seed.
- iteration 2: 0.064 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.064). No code change. The agent wrote a notebook and left the parent in place.
- iteration 1: 0.077 kept (registered). Increases the mean by 0.013 (from 0.064 to 0.077). Capped a weak-hunger corpse walk at 20 squares.
- iteration 2: 0.077 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.077). The judge table matches iteration 1.
- iteration 1: 0.077 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.077). No code change.
- iteration 2: 0.077 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.077). Read the spell menu and deleted the cast.
- iteration 1: none not kept (gate:child identical to parent). The tree matched the parent, so the judge did not run.
- iteration 1: 0.077 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.077). Resubmitted the spell-menu tree. The 15 seeds match the parent.
- iteration 1: 0.077 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.077). Drew a negative ring for a fast adjacent monster. The 15 seeds match the parent, because melee is still worth 16.
- iteration 1: 0.040 not kept (no-cell-improved). Decreases the mean by 0.037 (from 0.077 to 0.040). Visited unseen tiles before a search. Seeds 10 and 12 rose. Seed 13 fell from 0.179 to 0.024.
- iteration 1: 0.080 kept (registered). Increases the mean by 0.003 (from 0.077 to 0.080). Latched onto dungeon level 2 when fainting and no edible corpse was within 20 squares. The melee function did not change.
- iteration 1: 0.114 kept (registered). Increases the mean by 0.034 (from 0.080 to 0.114). Waited for experience level 12 before it left the first Doom level. Seeds 4, 8, 10, and 12 did not change. Seed 14 fell from 0.117 to 0.075.
- iteration 1: 0.114 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.114). Changed the launcher penalty. The 15 seeds match the parent.
- iteration 2: none. The job was cancelled at 360 minutes. No score.
- iteration 1: 0.114 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.114). Submitted the launcher edit again. The 15 seeds match the parent.

## Why it stopped

The parent batch is not in this note.

## What is the problem

Mean progress is unknown. The bot is kept only if the next mean is strictly higher on `wiz-hum-cha-mal`.

## What might solve it

Progress is the highest milestone a game reaches. The judge score is the mean of 15 seeds. A child is kept only when that mean is strictly higher. Your task is to raise the score. You use the knowledge in `GAME_RULES.md`. Make one change. That change is one new function, or one rewrite of one function. Do not repeat a listed action. The one change raises the score. It does not lower the score. Do not revert the change. The judge scores the tree you exit with. A tree that matches the parent is not a result. `experience.md` holds the ends of the played games. Read it and describe why the bot lost. Propose one change in this file, in accordance with the game rules. Name the one function you add or the one function you rewrite. Change the bot from that proposal.

Change the bot from the proposal above. The judge measures that tree.
