# Next experiment

## Result

- iteration 1: 0.063 not kept (no-cell-improved). Decreases the mean by 0.001 (from 0.064 to 0.063). Moved the weak-hunger eat step to the front of the strategy list.
- iteration 2: 0.060 not kept (no-cell-improved). Decreases the mean by 0.003 (from 0.063 to 0.060). Lowered that threshold from weak to hungry.
- iteration 1: 0.064 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.064). Added a corpse-distance cap that the weak-hunger gate never reaches.
- iteration 2: 0.063 not kept (no-cell-improved). Decreases the mean by 0.002 (from 0.064 to 0.063). Raised several flee and Elbereth thresholds and ate more corpses from the pack.
- iteration 1: 0.064 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.064). No code change. The tree matches the seed.
- iteration 2: 0.064 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.064). No code change. The agent wrote a notebook and left the parent in place.
- iteration 1: 0.077 kept (registered). Increases the mean by 0.013 (from 0.064 to 0.077). Capped a weak-hunger corpse walk at 20 squares.
- iteration 2: 0.077 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.077). The judge table matches iteration 1.
- iteration 1: 0.077 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.077). No code change.
- iteration 2: 0.077 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.077). Read the spell menu and deleted the cast.
- iteration 1: none not kept (gate:child identical to parent). The tree matched the parent, so the judge did not run.
- iteration 1: 0.077 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.077). Resubmitted the spell-menu tree. The 15 seeds match the parent.
- iteration 1: 0.077 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.077). Drew a negative ring for a fast adjacent monster. The 15 seeds match the parent, because melee is still worth 16.
- iteration 1: 0.040 not kept (no-cell-improved). Decreases the mean by 0.037 (from 0.077 to 0.040). Visited unseen tiles before a search. Seeds 10 and 12 rose. Seed 13 fell from 0.179 to 0.024.
- iteration 1: 0.080 kept (registered). Increases the mean by 0.003 (from 0.077 to 0.080). Latched onto dungeon level 2 when fainting and no edible corpse was within 20 squares. The melee function did not change.
- iteration 1: 0.114 kept (registered). Increases the mean by 0.034 (from 0.080 to 0.114). Waited for experience level 12 before it left the first Doom level. Seeds 4, 8, 10, and 12 did not change. Seed 14 fell from 0.117 to 0.075.
- iteration 1: 0.114 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.114). Changed the launcher penalty. The 15 seeds match the parent.
- iteration 2: none. The job was cancelled at 360 minutes. No score.
- iteration 1: 0.114 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.114). Submitted the launcher edit again. The 15 seeds match the parent.

## Why it stopped

The parent batch is not in this note.

## What is the problem

Mean progress is unknown. The bot is kept only if the next mean is strictly higher on `wiz-hum-cha-mal`.

## What might solve it

Progress is the highest milestone a game reaches. The judge score is the mean of 15 seeds. Change one test that already exists. Do not add a new action. Describe the games in `experience.md`. Propose one change in this file, in accordance with the game rules. Change the bot from that proposal.

## Proposed change

Change the one test that holds the wizard inside `fight2`: the disengage test `if not monsters or all(dis > 7 for dis, *_ in monsters) or ...` in `agent.py`.

The parent leaves `fight2` only when no visible monster is within seven squares of the wizard, and `fight2` is registered ahead of the eating group and ahead of the rest loop. So a monster standing five or six squares away blocks the weak-hunger corpse walk (which the same parent is willing to make for up to 20 squares) and blocks `exploration_strategy(None).until(hp >= 0.8 * max_hitpoints)`. The wizard kites instead of eating, hunger runs weak -> fainting, and a faint next to a monster is a death; it also takes every unavoidable fight below 80% of its maximum hit points.

Make the test read

    if not monsters or all(dis > 7 or (dis > 4 and self.blstats.hunger_state >= Hunger.WEAK)
                           for dis, *_ in monsters) or \

so that once the wizard is weak a monster more than four squares away no longer pins it: it goes and eats the corpse, eats from the pack, or rests, exactly as the rules ask ("Eat before a faint. A faint next to a monster is a death."). A monster within four squares still takes the turn, so the walk to the corpse is abandoned as soon as the threat closes. Nothing changes while the wizard is fed, no new action is added, and no measured test is touched: the `+15` melee bonus, `imminent_death_on_melee`, the 20 square corpse walk and the fainting latch are all left alone.

Change the bot from the proposal above. The judge measures that tree.
