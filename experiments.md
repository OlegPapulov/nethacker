# Next mutator experiment

Applied in this commit. The operator brief says the mean falls when a long game loses a milestone, even when a short game lasts longer.

## Result

Run 37397657802 used `--effort xhigh` for three iterations. Each iteration starts from the 0.114 parent, because no child is kept.

- iteration 1: 0.053290418490603744 not kept (no-cell-improved). Decreases the mean by 0.061 (from 0.114 to 0.053). Picks up coins only while `_drop_gold_till_turn` is still active.
- iteration 2: 0.09002482586758531 not kept (no-cell-improved). Decreases the mean by 0.024 (from 0.114 to 0.090). `can_engrave` returns false while hit points are below the maximum.
- iteration 3: 0.07239138816724316 not kept (no-cell-improved). Decreases the mean by 0.042 (from 0.114 to 0.072). Walks away when `2 * difficulty * difficulty` exceeds current hit points.

## What is the problem

Each comment calls the edit an improvement. The edit runs for every seed. A short seed can rise while seed 9 loses a milestone. The mean then falls.

Iteration 1 raises seeds 4, 8, and 12. Seed 9 falls from 0.255 to 0.029. Iteration 2 raises seed 6 from 0.179 to 0.255. Seeds 3 and 5 fall from 0.179 to 0.029. Seed 9 falls from 0.255 to 0.179. Iteration 3 leaves seeds 4, 8, and 12 on the parent turn counts. Seed 9 falls from 0.255 to 0.051.

## What might solve it

Do not put any of these three diffs on the bot. The next operator sentence should say that the mean falls when a long game loses a milestone, even when a short game lasts longer. Do not name the gold test, `can_engrave`, or `movement_priority` in that sentence. Naming a symbol makes the operator edit that symbol.

## Result

- iteration 1: 0.066 not kept (no-cell-improved). Decreases the mean by 0.048 (from 0.114 to 0.066). Added `cast_at_monsters` before `fight2`. Run 37383680703.

## Proposal (not approved)
Source: the last mutator iteration. Applying this means editing `mutator/`, which needs a human yes.

# Next experiment

## Result

- iteration 1: 0.063 not kept (no-cell-improved). Decreases the mean by 0.001 (from 0.064 to 0.063). Moved the weak-hunger eat step to the front of the strategy list.
- iteration 2: 0.060 not kept (no-cell-improved). Decreases the mean by 0.003 (from 0.063 to 0.060). Lowered that threshold from weak to hungry.
- iteration 1: 0.064 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.064). Added a corpse-distance cap that the weak-hunger gate never reaches.
- iteration 2: 0.063 not kept (no-cell-improved). Decreases the mean by 0.002 (from 0.064 to 0.063). Raised several flee and Elbereth thresholds and ate more corpses from the pack.
- iteration 1: 0.064 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.064). No code change. The tree matches the seed.
- iteration 2: 0.064 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.064). No code change. The agent wrote a notebook and left the parent in place.
- iteration 1: 0.077 kept (registered). Increases the mean by 0.013 (from 0.064 to 0.077). Capped a weak-hunger corpse walk at 20 squares.
- iteration 2: 0.077 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.077). The judge table matches iteration 1.
- iteration 1: 0.077 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.077). No code change.
- iteration 2: 0.077 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.077). Read the spell menu and deleted the cast.
- iteration 1: none not kept (gate:child identical to parent). The tree matched the parent, so the judge did not run.
- iteration 1: 0.077 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.077). Resubmitted the spell-menu tree. The 15 seeds match the parent.
- iteration 1: 0.077 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.077). Drew a negative ring for a fast adjacent monster. The 15 seeds match the parent, because melee is still worth 16.
- iteration 1: 0.040 not kept (no-cell-improved). Decreases the mean by 0.037 (from 0.077 to 0.040). Visited unseen tiles before a search. Seeds 10 and 12 rose. Seed 13 fell from 0.179 to 0.024.
- iteration 1: 0.080 kept (registered). Increases the mean by 0.003 (from 0.077 to 0.080). Latched onto dungeon level 2 when fainting and no edible corpse was within 20 squares. The melee function did not change.
- iteration 1: 0.114 kept (registered). Increases the mean by 0.034 (from 0.080 to 0.114). Waited for experience level 12 before it left the first Doom level. Seeds 4, 8, 10, and 12 did not change. Seed 14 fell from 0.117 to 0.075.
- iteration 1: 0.114 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.114). Changed the launcher penalty. The 15 seeds match the parent.
- iteration 2: none. The job was cancelled at 360 minutes. No score.
- iteration 1: 0.114 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.114). Submitted the launcher edit again. The 15 seeds match the parent.

## Why it stopped

The parent batch is not in this note.

## What is the problem

Mean progress is unknown. The bot is kept only if the next mean is strictly higher on `wiz-hum-cha-mal`.

## What might solve it

The score is the mean of the 15 judge seeds. Progress is the highest milestone a game reaches. Experience level moves that score. Seed 9 is at Xp:11. Seed 4 dies at 2,742 turns and stops at Xp:2. Seeds 10 and 12 die under 10,000 turns. Leave the weak-hunger corpse walk capped at 20 squares. Leave `_xp_farm_level` as it is. Leave `experience_level >= 12` as it is. Describe the games in `experience.md`. Propose one change in this file, in accordance with the game rules. Change the bot from that proposal.
