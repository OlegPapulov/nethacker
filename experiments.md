# Next experiment

## Result

- iteration 1: 0.063 not kept (no-cell-improved). Decreases the mean by 0.001 (from 0.064 to 0.063). Moved the weak-hunger eat step to the front of the strategy list.
- iteration 2: 0.060 not kept (no-cell-improved). Decreases the mean by 0.003 (from 0.063 to 0.060). Lowered that threshold from weak to hungry.
- iteration 1: 0.064 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.064). Added a corpse-distance cap that the weak-hunger gate never reaches.
- iteration 2: 0.063 not kept (no-cell-improved). Decreases the mean by 0.002 (from 0.064 to 0.063). Raised several flee and Elbereth thresholds and ate more corpses from the pack.
- iteration 1: 0.064 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.064). No code change. The tree matches the seed.
- iteration 2: 0.064 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.064). No code change. The agent wrote a notebook and left the parent in place.
- iteration 1: 0.077 kept (registered). Increases the mean by 0.013 (from 0.064 to 0.077). Capped a weak-hunger corpse walk at 20 squares.
- iteration 2: 0.077 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.077). The judge table matches iteration 1.
- iteration 1: 0.077 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.077). No code change.
- iteration 2: 0.077 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.077). Read the spell menu and deleted the cast.
- iteration 1: none not kept (gate:child identical to parent). The tree matched the parent, so the judge did not run.
- iteration 1: 0.077 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.077). Resubmitted the spell-menu tree. The 15 seeds match the parent.
- iteration 1: 0.077 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.077). Drew a negative ring for a fast adjacent monster. The 15 seeds match the parent, because melee is still worth 16.

## Why it stopped

killed by a soldier ant (2 of 15).

## What is the problem

Mean progress is 0.077. The bot is kept only if the next mean is strictly higher on `wiz-hum-cha-mal`.

## What might solve it

The usual stop is killed by a soldier ant, and that game is already long. The mean moves when a game under 10,000 turns lasts longer. Leave the weak-hunger corpse walk capped at 20 squares. Do not edit it. Do not edit `movement_priority.py` or `character.py`. Five games end under 10,000 turns, all on depth 1: a kobold zombie at 2,644, a bat at 4,917, a coyote at 6,746, a bat at 9,791, and a newt at 9,957. Those are the games that move the mean. A soldier ant that already lasts about 20,000 turns is not the edit. Do not shorten a long game. In `melee_monster_priority`, do not add 15 when `imminent_death_on_melee` is true. A coyote, a kobold zombie, and a newt are not in `is_monster_faster`, so a faster-only check misses them. Return a priority below every adjacent walkable step. Edit only that function.

Edit `autoascend/` and exit. The judge measures that tree.
