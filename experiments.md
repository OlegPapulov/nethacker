# Next experiment

## Result

- iteration 1: 0.063 not kept (no-cell-improved). Decreases the mean by 0.001 (from 0.064 to 0.063). Moved the weak-hunger eat step to the front of the strategy list.
- iteration 2: 0.060 not kept (no-cell-improved). Decreases the mean by 0.003 (from 0.063 to 0.060). Lowered that threshold from weak to hungry.
- iteration 1: 0.064 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.064). Added a corpse-distance cap that the weak-hunger gate never reaches.
- iteration 2: 0.063 not kept (no-cell-improved). Decreases the mean by 0.002 (from 0.064 to 0.063). Raised several flee and Elbereth thresholds and ate more corpses from the pack.
- iteration 1: 0.064 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.064). No code change. The tree matches the seed.
- iteration 2: 0.064 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.064). No code change. The agent wrote a notebook and left the parent in place.
- iteration 1: 0.077 kept (registered). Increases the mean by 0.013 (from 0.064 to 0.077). Capped a weak-hunger corpse walk at 20 squares.
- iteration 2: 0.077 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.077). The judge table matches iteration 1.
- iteration 1: 0.077 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.077). No code change.
- iteration 2: 0.077 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.077). Read the spell menu and deleted the cast.
- iteration 1: none not kept (gate:child identical to parent). The tree matched the parent, so the judge did not run.
- iteration 1: 0.077 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.077). Resubmitted the spell-menu tree. The 15 seeds match the parent.
- iteration 1: 0.077 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.077). Drew a negative ring for a fast adjacent monster. The 15 seeds match the parent, because melee is still worth 16.
- iteration 1: 0.040 not kept (no-cell-improved). Decreases the mean by 0.037 (from 0.077 to 0.040). Visited unseen tiles before a search. Seeds 10 and 12 rose. Seed 13 fell from 0.179 to 0.024.
- iteration 1: 0.080 kept (registered). Increases the mean by 0.003 (from 0.077 to 0.080). Latched onto dungeon level 2 when fainting and no edible corpse was within 20 squares. The melee function did not change.
- iteration 1: 0.114 kept (registered). Increases the mean by 0.034 (from 0.080 to 0.114). Waited for experience level 12 before it left the first Doom level. Seeds 4, 8, 10, and 12 did not change. Seed 14 fell from 0.117 to 0.075.
- iteration 1: 0.114 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.114). Changed the launcher penalty. The 15 seeds match the parent.
- iteration 2: none. The job was cancelled at 360 minutes. No score.
- iteration 1: 0.114 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.114). Submitted the launcher edit again. The 15 seeds match the parent.
- proposal: rewrite `emergency_strategy` in `autoascend/agent.py`. Pray for food as soon as hunger reaches weak, not fainting. The god counts weak hunger as the same starvation trouble the game checks, so the prayer is valid there too, and asking one step earlier keeps the wizard out of the helpless faint that the melee monsters kill. The prayer cooldown is unchanged.

## Why it stopped

The parent batch is not in this note.

## What is the problem

Mean progress is unknown. The bot is kept only if the next mean is strictly higher on `wiz-hum-cha-mal`.

## What might solve it

Progress is the highest milestone a game reaches. The judge score is the mean of 15 seeds. A child is kept only when that mean is strictly higher. Your task is to raise the score. You use the knowledge in `GAME_RULES.md`. Make one change. That change is one new function, or one rewrite of one function. The change is one small step up the score. Keep the step only when the mean rises. Do not repeat a listed action. A listed action is a finished measurement. A listed action covers the measured situation and a similar situation. A similar situation is the same action. The one change raises the score. It does not lower the score. Do not revert the change. The judge scores the tree you exit with. A tree that matches the parent is not a result. `experience.md` holds the ends of the played games. Read it and describe why the bot lost. Propose one change in this file, in accordance with the game rules. Name the one function you add or the one function you rewrite. Change the bot from that proposal.

Change the bot from the proposal above. The judge measures that tree.
