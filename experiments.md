# Next experiment

## Result

- iteration 1: 0.063 not kept (no-cell-improved). Decreases the mean by 0.001 (from 0.064 to 0.063). Moved the weak-hunger eat step to the front of the strategy list.
- iteration 2: 0.060 not kept (no-cell-improved). Decreases the mean by 0.003 (from 0.063 to 0.060). Lowered that threshold from weak to hungry.
- iteration 1: 0.064 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.064). Added a corpse-distance cap that the weak-hunger gate never reaches.
- iteration 2: 0.063 not kept (no-cell-improved). Decreases the mean by 0.002 (from 0.064 to 0.063). Raised several flee and Elbereth thresholds and ate more corpses from the pack.
- iteration 1: 0.064 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.064). No code change. The tree matches the seed.
- iteration 2: 0.064 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.064). No code change. The agent wrote a notebook and left the parent in place.
- iteration 1: 0.077 kept (registered). Increases the mean by 0.013 (from 0.064 to 0.077). Capped a weak-hunger corpse walk at 20 squares.
- iteration 2: 0.077 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.077). The judge table matches iteration 1.
- iteration 1: 0.077 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.077). No code change.
- iteration 2: 0.077 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.077). Read the spell menu and deleted the cast.
- iteration 1: none not kept (gate:child identical to parent). The tree matched the parent, so the judge did not run.
- iteration 1: 0.077 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.077). Resubmitted the spell-menu tree. The 15 seeds match the parent.
- iteration 1: 0.077 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.077). Drew a negative ring for a fast adjacent monster. The 15 seeds match the parent, because melee is still worth 16.
- iteration 1: 0.040 not kept (no-cell-improved). Decreases the mean by 0.037 (from 0.077 to 0.040). Visited unseen tiles before a search. Seeds 10 and 12 rose. Seed 13 fell from 0.179 to 0.024.
- iteration 1: 0.080 kept (registered). Increases the mean by 0.003 (from 0.077 to 0.080). Latched onto dungeon level 2 when fainting and no edible corpse was within 20 squares. The melee function did not change.
- iteration 1: 0.114 kept (registered). Increases the mean by 0.034 (from 0.080 to 0.114). Waited for experience level 12 before it left the first Doom level. Seeds 4, 8, 10, and 12 did not change. Seed 14 fell from 0.117 to 0.075.
- iteration 1: 0.114 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.114). Changed the launcher penalty. The 15 seeds match the parent.
- iteration 2: none. The job was cancelled at 360 minutes. No score.
- iteration 1: 0.114 not kept (no-cell-improved). Does not change the mean (0.114). Submitted the launcher edit again. The 15 seeds match the parent.

## Proposal

Change one test that already exists: the hunger gate for the 20-square corpse walk in `agent.py`.

Currently, `eat_corpses_from_ground` walks up to 5 squares for food when hungry (hunger_state < WEAK), and up to 20 squares when weak (hunger_state >= WEAK). The hypothesis behind this was: avoid long corpse hunts when just hungry to save turns; only go far when weak.

That hypothesis is wrong for this character. A chaotic male human wizard has few hit points and dies to weak monsters (goblin, newt, kitten, kobold lord) when already weakened by hunger. Seeds 4, 8, 10, and 12 die at Xp:2-6 with only 2742-9957 turns, because the wizard spends turns at hunger WEAK before it finds food, and then dies to the first monster that arrives. Waiting until WEAK to allow a 20-square walk is too late: the wizard is already vulnerable.

Change the hunger gate from WEAK to HUNGRY. When hungry (not just weak), allow the wizard to walk up to 20 squares for a corpse. This keeps the wizard healthier earlier, so it survives long enough to farm the XP that the score counts.

The XP curve makes this worth trying: Xp:8 is worth 0.0745, Xp:10 is worth 0.179, Xp:11 is worth 0.255. A wizard that banks Xp:8-10 on the Doom floors instead of dying at Xp:2-6 has already more than doubled or tripled its score. The food walk is the only lever that keeps the wizard alive long enough to get there.

## Why it stopped

The parent batch is not in this note.

## What is the problem

Mean progress is 0.1144. The bot is kept only if the next mean is strictly higher on `wiz-hum-cha-mal`.

## What might solve it

Progress is the highest milestone a game reaches. The judge score is the mean of 15 seeds. Change one test that already exists. Do not add a new action. Describe the games in `experience.md`. Propose one change in this file, in accordance with the game rules. Change the bot from that proposal.

Change the bot from the proposal above. The judge measures that tree.
