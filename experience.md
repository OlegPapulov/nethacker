# Mutator runs

## Run wiz-hum-cha-mal, 10-minute cap, 3 iterations

The parent batch mean was 0.062. Nine of 15 games end at depth 1. One official death is starvation (seed 13). The written experiment told the agent the usual stop was "killed by a wolf" (2 games) and to change melee.

### Why it stopped

All three iterations exited 137. That is the 10-minute `docker kill`. The agent was still in tool calls or reasoning. No edit was scored (`dev_fitness` empty). The log recorded each iteration twice.

### What is the problem

The cap is doing what it was set to do, and the prompt spends that window re-playing seeds the notes already list. On the last iteration the model had found seed 3 fainting from lack of food and seed 13 starving, and it was about to write its own eval harness when it was killed.

### What might solve it

The notes must forbid another arena run, and a starvation or fainting death must become the experiment even when a monster name is more common. The run log must keep a short reason, not the model's transcript.

## Run 36861664309, wiz-hum-cha-mal, 10-minute cap, 3 iterations

[36861664309](https://github.com/OlegPapulov/nethacker/actions/runs/36861664309) finished with the job green and `0/3` elites. Cold-start mean was 0.062 (the table printed 0.063). Nine of 15 games end at depth 1. The modal death is a wolf (seeds 4 and 11). Seed 13 dies of starvation at 5,206 turns on depth 1. Seed 3 dies to a grid bug at 3,052 turns.

The seed notes already said to eat before exploring and not to re-play the seeds. The agent never rewrote them (`notes_ignored` true).

### Why it stopped

Each coding container was killed at the 10-minute cap. Wall times inside `evolve`: iteration 1 at 819s (~601s of thinking), iteration 2 at 1436s (~615s), iteration 3 at 2052s (~614s). Exit 137, then `aborting — 3 consecutive operator failures`. `dev_fitness` is empty on all three. The only event left in the Actions log is an OpenCode `step_start`. No tool result, no diff, no score.

### What is the problem

The default reasoning variant of `opencode/big-pickle` does not finish one edit inside 10 minutes. The Actions log no longer shows a diagnosis transcript, because the kill lands before a step completes. A longer transcript would not help: the iteration is discarded either way.

### What might solve it

Pass `--effort medium` (OpenCode applies that as `--variant medium` on the pinned model) and kill the container at 20 minutes. The bot experiment stays "eat before exploring."
